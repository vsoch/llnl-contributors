# LLNL Contributors

This is a small project to use a subset of data from [the LLNL open source site](https://llnl.github.io/)
to quickly answer:

 - What is the breakdown of interal vs. external contributors for LLNL open source repositories.
 - Within a repository, where do our contributors come from?
 - Which repositories have opportunity to improve documentation and engagement?
 
If we can pair this with a primary purpose of each repository, we might be able
to say "This tool has a strong use case for the external community but doesn't
seem to be well known."

## Breakdown of contributors

You can see the interface [here](https://vsoch.github.io/llnl-contributors/) to
get a sense of how repositories break down between external and internal contributors,
and read comments for each plot on the page. These plots are updated on a nightly
basis with a [github workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml).

## Contributor Friendliness Analysis

I plan to look closely at individual projects and make an assessment about
how well they are doing in terms of documentation, branding, getting started / install
/ tutorials, etc.
